# Launching OSS Lab at University of Cincinnati

## Why are we doing this?
We are building a leaderboard for open-source contributions of UC students. The primary goal is to encourage students to make open-source contributions, improving their github profile, and developing software collaboration skills.

## Who is this for?
In one word: for **students**. We want to recognize and reward students who make open source contributions.

### Who else can benefit?
This can also be a useful tool for employers to review an applicant's oss contributions, area of interests and expertise.

## How to get started 
<!-- or Getting Started or How to get on the leaderboard -->
You can be on the OSS Leaderboard in 2 simple steps
1. Submit the quick sign-up form using your school .edu email
2. If you would like us to track projects you have contributed to, create a PR by adding the links to the project to the `projects.txt` file. 

Congratulations, you already have a headstart because the above PR counts as a commit ;)

## How to contribute
We use Github Issues OR Github projects to track the bugs, new features and improvements. If you find one that ___ your interests, assign the issue to yourself and get started. 

You can also always contribute by reporting bugs and possible improvements.
